Note Application

Introduction: this is a fun app. Please suggest and add new things. (will check for commits)
WORKING IN PROGRESS. WILL BE EDITED.


The most important aspect in the Note Application is to not lose our rythm and keep track of our current tasks.

Aim of this app is to make an APP that has all the following :
1. TO DO list (this is major)
2. diary function
3. Note application

# Wire framing IMP in DESC

Most important! : What i have to do , TODAY.

important : What have i accomplished /finished. 

important less 1: If not finished today WHY?/ Can i move it to tomorrow? (Can i move to Tomorrow/directory in easy manner?) eg(if i click/drag on my note tomorrow bar pops up where i can move or to move to specific date)

important less 2: Alarm setting. (This is one of the major things that annoys users the most. Is there any way where we are not too annoyed but reminded at the same time?.)

important less 3: tomorrow / Other Dates (future) Tasks

important less 4: Explained in 1 but but if i hold/click on my NOTE for duration amount of time IT HAS TO BE MOVEABLE EASILY EVEN FROM MY TODAYS NOTE. sometimes we write this memo and we realize "OH this is different date" (eg If held on for long time Date(explained in 1) pops up , when i click on that date it gives me the list of columns LIST (user custimized) and if i click column it shows as a DROP-DOWN style where i can put it in the specific position of that LIST.)

important less 5: in my account settings i have Search bar so that i can find where it is. (depending on the UI this can be within the note app as well.)

important less 6: Weather forcast on that date. 

important less 7: CUSTIMIZABLE ACCOUNT SETTING. -> WHEN i CLICK on my setting i can customize however my page wants to look. we have default and customizable. When i click on today, on my top right with the setting icon i should be able to make an column (like trello) and make a TODAY'S task // IN PROGRESS // DONE settings 

improtant less 8: CNTRL Z function 

important less 9: BACK UP

important less 10: drawing. i dont find IMG and drawing as important, however, for people who are graphical minded, there could be some improment towards this idea.



# key note
This is a TO DO list app. the key aspect is that it is CUSTOMIZABLE by the USER and easily moved to different categories.




# UI 
eg) 20*20 memo box. when this is clicked for long time, there may be a half circle shaped calender and it will spin like a lock and when i press on the center of its lock, i can select other specific dates.
